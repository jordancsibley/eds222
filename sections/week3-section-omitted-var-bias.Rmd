# Omitted Variable Bias 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
N <- 100
x1 <- rnorm(N)
x2 <- 2 + -3 * x1 + rnorm(N, sd = 1)
  
  
beta0 <- 5
beta1 <- 1.5
beta2 <- -0.5
sigma <- 2

y <- beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2 + rnorm(N, sd = sigma)
# yhat 

dat <- tibble(y, x1, x2)
```


```{r}
# Estimate beta1 while ignoring x2
summary(lm(y ~x1, dat))
```

## Estimate of beta1 is 2.9 

```{r}
# Estimate beta1, accounting for x2
summary(lm(y ~ x2, dat))
```

It is important to know which variables could have affect on parameter you are examining. Bringing in the ecological knowledge will help to better understand which variables may interact


If variables are no longer correlated, you can estimate betas and ignore the others and still get similar values. 


What assumption of OLS is violated by the omitted varaible? 
-  The X variable is exogenous i.e E[u | X] = 0
-  There is not other variable correlated with X that also affects Y
