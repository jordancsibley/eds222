```{r}
# set up 
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# plot of coin flip 
set.seed(1234) # setting the seed of random numbers for reproduciblity 

lln_norm <- tibble( # create dataframe 
  n_sz = sample(5:500, 1e4, replace = TRUE), #1000 samples
  sample_mean = sapply(n_sz, function(n) mean(rnorm(n))) # mean of samples we drew for every row 
)

ggplot(data = lln_norm) +
  geom_point(aes(x = n_sz, y = sample_mean), alpha = 0.25, shape = 20) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
             color = "cyan4") +
  labs(x = "Sample size",
       y = "Sample mean") +
  theme_bw()
```

Notes for HW 

ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_point(aes(x = long, y = lat, color = source))
  
  
```{r}
